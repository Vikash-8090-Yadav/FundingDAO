## üí• Challenges we ran into

**Smart contract:**
- Building scalable smart contracts is a challenging task that requires hard work and dedication. Despite the difficulties, we were able to make it happen. Our main challenge was to make the contract dynamic and responsive to all users. For instance, if a user adds a course, it should only be visible on their dashboard, not to everyone who logs in to the DApp.

- Additionally, we faced significant difficulties in enabling users to resell courses. We wanted to allow users to buy and sell courses at different prices, and we had to ensure that the marketplace displayed the new price, but only to the user. Making it dynamic and connecting it to the marketplace was a challenge.



**Frontend:**
- The biggest challenge that I faced was to make the website compatiable with the browser and the device. This is the first thing which is to be kept in mind as a front-end developer to ensure that the website looks good and performs well on all existing browsers and devices with different screen sizes.
  
- Next thing was to deal with the performance of the website. Since, if the website gives good performance and does the task in a speedy manner then it can reach to many problems and solve their issues. So, optimising the code is the next big task.
  
- Debugging is another big challenge. Finding and fixing errors in code can be a tedious task at times. Developers can use browser dev tools, error console, and testing to debug their code effectively.
